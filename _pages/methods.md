# Methods

## Biological models

Culturing and genetic manipulations including CRISPR-based approches.

- Cell lines: K562, A549, HeLa, Caco-2, Calu-1, LR7
- Mouse embrionic stem cells (mESC)
- Budding yeast (<i>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</i>)

## High-throughput methods

- CRAC (UV cross-linking and analysis of cDNA), method that provides high-resolution maps of RNA-protein interactions. We use CRAC to investigate RNA binding proteins and the dynamics of RNA transcription
- ChIP-nexus to investigate DNA-protein interactions, a high-resolution modification of the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) method.
- RNA-seq
- tRNA-seq

## <i>In vitro</i> biochemistry

- Purification of large complexes for <i>in vitro</i> assays: RNA polymerases, pre-ribosomes etc
- RNA polymerase I and II <i>in vitro</i> assays: elongation and backtracking
- SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase elongation assay
- Cleavage assay of PIN-domain endonucleases (i.e. Nob1)


## Data analysis and mathematical modelling:

- RNA-seq, tRNA-seq, CRAC/CLIP data analysis.
- Analysis of RNA polymerase dynamics
- Motif analysis
- Data science approach to cross-compare various types of datasets
- Mathematical modelling of dynamic processes with a major focus on transcription of RNA
- High-scale parametrization of DNA and RNA sequences to thermodynamic features (folding energy, melting energy, shape features etc.)
